		Key Definitions</h3>
	<p>
		IP Address: Internet Protocol (IP) is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the IP for communication.</p>
	<p>
		Cookies: Small text files that are stored by the browser on your connected device.</p>
	<p>
		Cache: A hardware or software component that stores data so future requests for that data can be served faster.</p>
	<p>
		We receive and store certain details whenever you interact with us. We log your Internet Protocol (IP) address so we can receive and send information from and to you online.</p>
	<p>
		Our website uses cookies to enable online transactions (first party cookies) and to track website usage patterns and inform our digital advertising (third party cookies). We may also track receipt, opening, click-through, and purchase and unsubscribe information for the emails we send.</p>
	<p>
		This site, like many others, uses small files called cookies to help customise your experience. 'Cookies' are small text files that are stored by the browser on your computer or mobile phone. Websites are able to read and write these files, allowing them store things such as personalisation details or user preferences. You can clear your cache of cookies by following the instructions in the Removing &amp; Disabling Cookies section, which you can find at the end of this document.</p>
	<p>
		Cookies provide a "memory" for the website, enabling it to recognise a user and respond appropriately. Each web domain can only access cookies stored by that specific web domain, meaning that only The Lowry servers can access the cookies set by the thelowry.com domains.</p>
	<h3>
		How and why we process personal data</h3>
	<p>
		<strong>Controllership and types of personal data we may hold about you</strong></p>
	<p>
		When you access Quayticket’s webpages we host, we collect personal data (such as your IP address and information about your device’s characteristics and capabilities) which forms part of the Usage Information we hold about you. We collect this Usage Information primarily via cookies and related technologies and we act as an independent data controller in relation to it. Where we share this personal data with others, they will also act as independent data controllers. Please refer to the section How and with whom we share personal data.</p>
	<p>
		The term “cookie” refers to one or more small pieces of information stored on or provided by your computer or device when you access online information. Your browser or device sends these cookies back to us every time you visit our pages, or it sends the cookies to another webpage that recognises the cookie, so each page can recognise you and can then, for example, tailor what you see on the screen. Other technologies, which are sometimes, called pixel tags and device fingerprinting work in a similar manner.</p>
	<p>
		We combine this Usage Information with some of your Account Information (such as your device’s MAC address) for the purposes described below.</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Purposes and legal bases</strong></p>
	<p>
		The primary purpose for which we use and share personal data in this context is to deliver and help personalise the advertisements you see. This includes advertisements on other websites you visit, apps you use or media you see (such as on social media, TV or online). This is in our legitimate interest as we want to ensure that the advertisements that are delivered to you are effective (for example, that the number of times you see the same ad is limited) and delivered to the right audiences.</p>
	<p>
		However, please note that it is optional for you to provide personal data in this context so if you would like us to stop using your personal data as described in this part of the cookie policy, please untick the box in the “Communicating with you” section of the In ‘My Account’. You can also manage cookies by disabling them or switching them off via the settings tool in your browser. Please note that doing so may impact your browsing experience when using the WiFi Services.</p>
	<p>
		We do not currently process personal data in the context of automated decision-making or profiling that would produce legal or other significant effects for you. If that changes at any time in the future, we will notify you beforehand as required.</p>
	<h3>
		How and with whom we share personal data</h3>
	<p>
		As explained in the section entitled “How and why we process personal data”, we may share your Usage Information combined with some of your Account Information with third party advertisers so that they can deliver or personalise the advertisements you see. Such as:</p>
	<p>
		• Facebook<br />
		• Google Display Network (GDN)<br />
		• Google Ads<br />
        • TickX<br />
		• Zendesk<br />
		• HotJar</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Our cookies help us:</strong></p>

		Granting us permission to use cookies</h3>
	<p>
		You can choose to accept or decline cookies optional cookies which are used for analytics and marketing purposes. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of our website. For example a session cookie stores your username and password for future use, so you would need to input this information each time you access the website.</p>
	<p>
		<strong>What cookies we use</strong></p>
	<p>
		We use a number of different types of cookies on the site:</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Session Cookies</strong></p>
	<p>
		We use a session cookie to remember your log-in details and what you’ve put in the shopping basket. These we deem strictly necessary to the working of the website. If these are disabled then various functionality on the site will not work, for example we will not be able to tailor content to you, we will be unable to count your site usage in our statistics and therefore be unable to develop the website in line with your needs.</p>

These so called “analytics” programs also tell us if, on an anonymous basis, how people reached this site (e.g. from a search engine) and whether they have been here before, helping us to put more money into developing our services for you instead of marketing spend.</p>
	<p>
